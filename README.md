***Quiz about movies***
===
With everyone stuck at home during quarantine, watching movies becomes one of the most favorite activities. We finally have enough time to catch up on everything we missed in the film industry during our busy working hours. This test is designed to find out how much of a cinephile you are and hopefully to add to your to-watch list a couple of new positions.

***Game process***
---
Quiz consists of three parts: frames, soundtracks and quotes. 
Difficulty level rises from the first question to the last during each part, as well as the number of points you can get for correct choice. You are not limited in time but you have only one chance to answer (for more details on how to play begin your quiz ;). 

### ***Frames***
A certain scene from a movie is being displayed, the task is to name from which one.
Pay attention to the details, there is often some hidden clue.

### ***Soundtracks***
It’s a part where you are supposed to listen closely and guess what film goes along with such theme. 
Every soundtrack is also followed by a photo of its composer or performer.

### ***Quotes***
When you think about a picture, there is always a most remembered piece that comes to your mind, during this level it’s on the opposite. You should remember the movie after hearing a piece from it.
Every quote has a little tip: the tagline of the movie.
